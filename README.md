# Gaiar-Neural-Kernel-Linux-3.18-0000
A whole implementation of the nervous system. To be employed on all devices.
This project aims to implement a fully functional Artificial intelligence engine
that is seif hosted solely on a computer system.

As the human brain/mind executes tightly with its content/memories,
its thus in order to follow the same structure while implementing 
intelligent systems.
The human brain:
     1) Brain matter (Hardware interfaces)
     2) Mind (Software and Kernel)
          a) Subconsciousness (Kernel)
          b) Consciousness (Realtime OS)
          
   The main aim of this neural kernel is to simulate steps 1, 2 and partially 3, Please note step 4
   is targeting init as is the first program to run on linux and is to be made available prior version 
   4 of the neural kernel. Step 4 can only be implemented in scpel.
