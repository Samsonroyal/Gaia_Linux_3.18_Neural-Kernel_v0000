# Gaiar-Neural-Kernel-Linux-3.18-0000
An entire implementation of the nervous system to be deployed on all devices.
This project aims to implement a fully functional Artificial intelligence engine
that is self hosted solely on a stand-alone computer system.

As the human brain/mind executes tightly with its content/memories,
it's thus in order to follow the same structure while implementing
intelligent systems.
The human brain:


     1) Brain matter (Hardware interfaces)
     2) Mind (Software and Kernel)
          a) Subconsciousness (Kernel)
          b) Consciousness (Realtime OS)
          
   The main aim of this neural kernel is to simulate steps 1, 2 and partially 2(a), Please note step 2(b)
   is targeting init as is the first program to run on linux and is to be made available prior version 
   2(b) of the neural kernel. Step 2(b) can only be implemented in scpel.
