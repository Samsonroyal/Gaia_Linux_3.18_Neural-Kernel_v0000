This onll focuses on 32 bit

run:
	build.sh
		To build kernel and initrd then a bootable qemu disk
	
	make config
		For a custom configuration then *make* to build the kernel
	
	make defconfig
		For an x86 default configuration then *make*
		
NOTE:
	This is the intoductory source of the neural kernel, as its structure is
	somewhat so complicated si this serves to introduce folks on kernel design
	as the second version will entirely be in C++ then the third in scpel (complete)
	Also not this source tree lacks any facet of AI code as is intended to lure more
	People to OSCA.
	
	I have not made available yet, a complete Neural kernel as I  wish not to
	alianate newbies from contibuting to AI as its better to first learn the standard
	structure.
