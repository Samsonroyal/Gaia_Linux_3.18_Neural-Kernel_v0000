WHAT WE NEED:
============
														  ---------------
	----------											 | - Mind		 |
   |Bootloader|----------					     ------->| - AI_Engine   |	
	----------			 |						|		 | Consciousness |
		a) video driver	 |		  --------	   	|		  ---------------
						  ------>| Kernel |-----
						  		  --------	
									a) video driver
									b) sound driver
									c) keyboard driver
									d) harddisk driver
									e) memory driver
									f) and other board/processor specific code

1)	Remove all unwanted code, some of which appears in warnings.
2)	Atleast remove one folder of either an unwanted/unnecessary driver or
	filesystem.
3)	Break the entire networking layer of the kernel, removing all "net" folders 
	and files plus all unwanted related code. AI requires no internet, for now.
4)	Make the kernel as bare as possible by removing all unstandard features,
	we'll have to look into those way later. ;-)
	
NOTE:
	This servers as a groomer on what the entire project is all about.
	This is specifically the right place to start as the actual kernel
	is so complex to thinking itself.
	
	1) This in C		(Systems Programmer)			Plain Kernel/OS system
	2) Second in C++	(Neural-Computer scientist)		Artificial System
	3) Third in sCpeL	(God Mode)						Electronic Mind/
														Consciousness
